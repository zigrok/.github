## 🎯 Our Mission

We believe Zig development should be powerful **and** pleasant. Our projects focus on making common tasks easier while staying true to Zig's philosophy of explicitness and control.

### The ZEASY Philosophy

Every zigrok project follows these principles:

- 🎨 **Ease of use over raw performance** - Intuitive APIs that just work
- 📚 **Clear documentation** - Examples that actually help
- 🔌 **Drop-in ready** - Minimal setup, maximum productivity
- 🛡️ **Safe by default** - Handle the common gotchas for you
- 🧩 **Composable** - Build complex solutions from simple parts
